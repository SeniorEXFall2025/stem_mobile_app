    "description": "CU Science Discovery is a science education outreach program of the University of Colorado Boulder’s Division of Continuing Education. Founded in 1983 to heighten young students’ interest in science, CU Science Discovery coordinates an array of programs that connect K-12 students and teachers to current CU science. Each program utilizes CU scientific expertise, equipment, resources and graduate or undergraduate students in order to provide K-12 students and teachers with unique, experiential learning STEM experiences. All programs are designed to be highly interactive and relevant, in order to engage students in the scientific process while connecting them to the science and technology present in their everyday lives.\n\nWe provide STEM programming during the school year (through in-school presentations and workshops, as well as after-school and day-off programming on the CU Boulder campus) as well as throughout the summer (we have a large summer camp program based on the CU Boulder campus, with some additional programs happening on the CU Anschutz medical campus). We partner with schools and school districts (eg, BVSD, Adams 12), public libraries, community organizations (eg, Nature Kids, E-Movement) and CU Boulder faculty, who frequently incorporate our programs as part of their Broader Impacts activities for federal grants. \n\nThrough hands-on summer camps and after-school classes, homeschool classes, teacher workshops, school programs, and community outreach events, Science Discovery impacts approximately 30,000 students, teachers and community members throughout Colorado each year.",

    "description": "eBodyGuard has created 4 innovations, with three of them launching in the next week, by November 15th, 2022.  The focus of the eBodyGuard technology, accessible at the App and Google Play store, for the community is to provide the ability for each and every person to have their needs met in their most vulnerable moments as they embrace 911; whether this is a medical need, safety need, a need for their family, and a need that involves their vehicle or pet within their location so First Responders can respond within a timely manner and support them specifically.  The voice activation of the technology provides access to activating this so that if 911 needs to be reached without touching their phone, this is also possible.  \n\nThe eBodyGuard eBodyCam is a new technology that finally gives video recording to the community in a fashion that is true objective evidence.  It works during the 911 call and without the 911 call.  Providing the community two minutes of high resolution recording; the moment the video has been taken; eBodyGuard protects the video and holds this for the community in the eBodyGuardcommunity.com where the Community/User can view their video.  If a crime occurs, and if 911 was utilized, this video is sent on to Law Enforcement to ensure the court process is supported.  Since eBodyGuard is an FBI CJIS secure company and follows all federal and state and local laws, the privacy of the data is strictly adhered to and also supports the needed bridging of this delicate gap between the individual's need and the government usage of the data:  only in case of a crime, will the data/video be provided. \n\nThe eBodyGuardCommunity.Com portal is also going live in mid-November along with the www.eBodyGuardPublicSafety.com portal.  These portals are going to mirror one another in that the User's Safety Card, eBodyCam, and any additional data and documents that are uploaded for the 911 call will be provided for view access only to the user.  They can enter the website through their passcode created on their App.  The community will view what data was provided to 911 and likewise what law enforcement now has.   \n\nWe believe Safety is primal and everyone deserves to know safety. Our base service is ALWAYS free and will remain free to everyone.  The additional eBodyCam coming to market will be a nominal optional in-App purchase to cover the cost of storage. \n\neBodyGuard, our mission:  We are the Bridge\nOur vision:  through technology, people, and processes because connections create safety.",

Students learn about groundwater from classroom visits and monitoring groundwater from wells located near their schools.  We also collaborate with the Poudre Learning Center and the City of Greeley on the Confluence Institute for K-12 teachers. This weeklong workshop is geared towards PROJECT WET activities that teachers can bring into their classrooms. The annual Children’s Water Festival, in its 29th year, is also an exciting project to work on. In April, we hosted the one-day event for 1,200 students from 50 different classrooms from three counties.",

Because laser technology has generally been limited to wavelengths only as short as 193 nm, scientific research in the VUV to SXR range has been relatively less explored. With recent developments in high harmonic generation (HHG), research in this area is coming of age and opening up exciting new opportunities for scientific discovery. Specifically, the potential for nanoscale imaging, spectroscopy, and probing ultrafast dynamics are extending the domain of nano and quantum experimentation beyond the specialized expertise of the laser physics lab and into the broader hands of materials scientists, engineers, geologists, and more.",

    "description": "The OERColorado Project is a statewide initiative to provide digital collections of free openly-licensed curriculum resources for Colorado educators to use in their teaching and classrooms. OERColorado.org is administered by the Colorado River Board of Cooperative Education Services (CR BOCES) and Colorado Empowered Learning (CEL) (C.R.S. § 22-5-119). The mission of OERColorado is to support Colorado educators, administrators, and other educational stakeholders in PK-12+ in using Open Educational Resources (OER) materials, share ideas, and create affordable, high quality learning resources.\nOER stands for Open Educational Resources. The resources in the OERColorado public digital libraries include free lessons, classes, textbooks, simulations, games, rubrics, icebreakers, and many other educational tools for teachers to use in face-to-face, online and blended learning environments. We make finding openly licensed resources easier by creating a one-stop location to: +Adopt, use, or customize an open access textbook, +Address learning loss and increase engagement, +Find evidence-based resources, +Supplement existing curriculum, +Locate niche curriculum like primary sources, historical information, Colorado focused career & technical education, +Adapt lessons to individual student needs to improve accessibility, +Find bilingual/bicultural materials, primary sources, Colorado-based examples and more, +Collaborate with others on shared curriculum, events and initiatives using built in groups and tools, +Create and share OER resources and materials",

Our mission emerged from a deep commitment to rewrite the narrative for Black K-12 learners, recognizing the systemic barriers they face in accessing a quality education. \n\nDSF is a beacon for change, dedicated to tailoring initiatives that celebrate and build upon the rich history and brilliance of our community. We understand that true empowerment extends beyond the classroom, encompassing families, communities, and the world at large. Our programs are designed to uplift scholars holistically, recognizing the interconnectedness of their personal and academic journeys. \n\nAt the heart of our mission lies the cultivation of future leaders and changemakers. We envision a STEAM landscape that mirrors the diversity and identities of its participants– a space where every voice is heard, valued, and empowered to innovate. \n\nThrough DSF, we embark on a transformative journey, championing equity, inclusivity, and excellence in STEAM education. Together, we pave the way for a brighter, more equitable future–one where every scholar has the opportunity to thrive and redefine what’s possible in the world of STEAM.",
